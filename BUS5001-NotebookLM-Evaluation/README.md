# BUS5001 Assessment 3 – NotebookLM Evaluation

## 🎓 Project Overview

This repository documents a pilot evaluation of **Google NotebookLM**, an AI-powered note-taking and summarisation assistant, for academic use at La Trobe University. It is part of Q4 in the BUS5001 – Cloud Platforms and Analytics subject.

The goal was to test NotebookLM’s feasibility for assisting students in:
- Summarising lecture materials
- Answering source-grounded questions
- Generating exam revision content
- Drafting research essay outlines

## 🧪 Prompt Log Summary

**Prompts used:**
1. Summarise this document in bullet points.  
2. What is the Shared Responsibility Model in cloud computing?  
3. Generate 3 multiple choice questions based on these notes.  
4. Help me outline a research essay on AI-based cloud monitoring.  
5. Compare AWS and Azure security tools.  
6. Create an outline for a research essay on AI and cloud ethics.

## 🧠 Key Findings

- NotebookLM **accurately extracted information** from well-structured PDFs.
- Its **citations were source-grounded**, helping ensure reliability.
- It was especially effective for students preparing for exams or assignments.

However:
- It **hallucinated** slightly when prompts were vague.
- It **requires clear, typed text** (PDFs with images/handwriting don't work well).
- **Privacy** considerations must be addressed before university-wide use.

## ✅ Conclusion

NotebookLM shows strong potential for integration into university learning environments, especially for guided study, revision, and early-stage research drafting. This GitHub repository demonstrates the feasibility and logs the entire experimental process with evidence.
